# hello, welcome!

## about
- self-taught python programmer
- (some) previous experience in lua, luau, and c
- majoring in CS this fall

## what i'm up to
i'm currently developing a python package with a friend called 'devgizmos'
it's meant to be a developer toolkit of sorts, containing useful classes/funcs for other codebases
it's more of a learning project but hopefully it will have some useful features
feel free to check it out at [Zentiph/devgizmos](https://github.com/Zentiph/devgizmos)
