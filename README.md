<h1 align="center">üëã Hello, welcome!</h1>

I'm **Gavin**, a first-year college student at RIT studying computer science.

I love building projects; I've been doing it since middle school. I started out experimenting with Roblox Studio, although I didn't start coding until my junior year of high school, which was when I learned HTML. From there, I learned Python my senior year, and then Java, CSS, and JS at RIT. I've also started to tinker with React, although I'm still fairly new.
