# Hello, welcome!
I'm Gavin, a first-year college student at RIT studying computer science.

## What I'm Up To
I'm currently developing a [personal Discord bot](https://github.com/Zentiph/CatBot) for me and my buddies as well as [my own programming language](https://github.com/Zentiph/Zen) to learn how they work.
